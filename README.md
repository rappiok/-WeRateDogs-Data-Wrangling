# -WeRateDogs-Data-Wrangling

This project aimed to: Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to provide engaging and reliable analysis and visualizations.
Perform data wrangling (collection, evaluation, and cleaning) on the three sources of data that are provided.
Organize, analyze, and visualize the wrangled data.

Additionally, only authentic tweets and ratings with images should be used in the analysis, following the project's specifications (no retweets nor replies).

## Results
The data wrangling process (data collection from different sources, data assessing and cleaning) resulted in two analytics-ready datasets used for a simplified analysis (full analysis is out of scope of this exercise).
